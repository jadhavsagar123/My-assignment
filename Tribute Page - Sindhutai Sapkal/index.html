<h3>Early life</h3>
    <hr>
    <div>
    <p>Sapkal was born on 14 November 1948,in Pimpri Meghe village in Wardha district in the then Central Provinces and Berar of British India to Abhimanyu Sathe,<br> a cowherder.Being an unwanted child, she was referred to as Chindhi (Marathi for "torn piece of cloth"). Abject poverty, family responsibilities and an early marriage <br> forced her to quit formal education after she successfully passed the fourth standard. Sapkal was married off at age to Shrihari Sapkal, who was 20 years elder to her, <br> and moved to Nawargaon village, Seloo in Wardha.The marriage did not last long and at the age of 20,she was left on her own to care for a girl child.</p>

    <h3>Early work with Adivasis</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Sindhutai Sapkal later found herself in Chikhaldara, where she started begging on railway platforms for food. In the process, she realised that there were many children abandoned by their parents and she adopted them as her own. She then begged more vigorously to feed them. She decided to become a mother to everyone who came across to her as an orphan. She later donated her biological child to the trust Shrimant Dagdu Sheth Halwai, Pune, to eliminate the feeling of partiality between her biological child and the adopted children.</p>
